**Cage Rooms & nearest Save Point**
The point of this was to see how viable it is to create "No Damage" cheevos for every individual cage room (as they have a multiplier).
This lists how far you could have to backtrack depending on where you saved last.
Each Cage Room lists recommended points in [square brackets] and lists every nearest save-point below it.
