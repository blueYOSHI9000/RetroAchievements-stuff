# blueYOSHMIN's RA Repository
A dumping ground for anything RetroAchievements that's either created or archived by me (the latter usually because I'm about to replace it).

## Notes / Info

### Credit
**NOT EVERYTHING HERE IS DONE BY ME!** The `Archive` folders include both my stuff but mainly also stuff from others that I replaced and then archived. I did not check who made anything since it's usually near impossible to really find out (mostly because the older Audit Log system is a bit barebones and some stuff is uploaded by other people instead of the one who made it).  
When in doubt, feel free to contact me and I'll at least be able to tell you if I made it (and if you don't have Audit Log access I can also check that).  
Anything outside `Archive` folders is almost definitely done by me though (there is a small exception for sprites that I ripped from the game).

### License / Can I use this?
Anything in an `Archive` folder is a default **no** as I likely didn't make that (as explained above), though when using it for RA anyway it's probably fine as all of it was made for RA in the first place.  
Anything *outside* an `Archive`	folder is free to use, no permission or credit needed (though credit appreciated when just re-uploading them as a whole).

### Hack Sorting
Hacks are displayed with a `N64 - SM64` for an SM64 hack. Anything that has a second prefix after the console is a hack.

### .xcf files / How to edit the badges?
.xcf are provided for all badges I made, if it's not there then I don't have it either lmao. You can open them in GIMP 2.8, later versions probably too but I use 2.8.

### Dates
All dates in the archives are date of archival, *not* date of creation.
